## Here is a list of things that I have told someone to convince them to use Laravel

_Many of these are taken from the laravel documentation._

- It uses latest PHP features. Needs "php": ">=5.5.9"
- Version 5.1 is LTS
- Makes dev env easier to set up with vagrant box (http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/homestead)
- laravelâ€™s homestead box comes with lot of software that are needed in a typical PHP application
- Works with PHP7
- Uses composer to maintain dependencies (http://getcomposer.org/)
- Composer has lot of advantages like autoloading
- Supports REST
- Helps in writing background jobs using Amazon SQS, Beanstalkd, IronMQ, Redis etc.. (http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/queues)
- Error logging is a breeze with Monolog
- Has built in support for testing tools like phpunit, mockery, phpspec etc
- Can create command line tools(?) with it
- Has MVC kind of architecture
- Has a HTML template engine called Blade which allows reusing the views
- Localization support
- Comes with a sharp command line knife `artisan`
- Can validate forms
- Can store sessions on different places (memcache, redis, files etc..)
- Cron jobs becomes easy and will be in source control
- Database schema will be in source control
- Makes database queries easier to write, if at all moving to another db(mysql to pgsql) no need to change the code
- Caching, dealing with files
- Asset management, has nice integration with gulp(node js family) to version assets, minification, combining several files into one etc..
- Very good community, Open source, lots of third party packages

*Good things come to those who wait
